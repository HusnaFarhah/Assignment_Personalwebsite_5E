<p style="text-align:left; font-family:Times New Roman;color: black;">19 August 2021, the long awaited day has arrived. It is my special day. Every years of my birthday, I will get a lot of wishes and celebration from my friends and family except for this year. I have waited the wishes from midnight till morning but no one gave it. I'm started overthink,does everyone forgot that today is my birthday especially my family. On that time, I feel dispointed and sad as nothing goes as my expectation. However, I still hoping that there is something good happen on my birthday. At the morning, my family just behaved like usual, no one looks like remember my special day. So I just pretend to be okay but deep inside I feel sad. On the afternoon, there is someone who is ring the bell at my home. I quickly look for it. Luckily, the man was holding a big bouqet of roses and teddy bears. I'so happy after he said that the present is on my name. Actually, my family have conspired to make a suprise on my birthday. My parent after that, took my other siblings and me to a beach. I really suprised as at the beach, there was a place beautifully decorated with birthday theme and filled with my acquaintances. They were here to celebrate my birthday. Everyone were conspired with my family in order to celebrate my special day. The celebration was simple yet excited. I was never so happy on my special day as I can enjoyed with all of my beloved.</p>

<p style="text-align:left; font-family:Times New Roman;color: black;">On my midsem break last week, my friends and I decided to go hiking at Bukit Tok Salai Sungai Nerus. This is my first time goes hiking. I'm really excited. We discussed together on whatsapp group about the hiking preparation such as what we need to brings, what time we will go and basic knowledge about hiking. I wake up early in the morning at 5 a.m because we decided to go at 6 a.m. Unfortunately, one of my friends did not wake up on time. So,our trip planning had to be changed. Luckily, we manage to arrive at there by 7 a.m. As this is my first time hiking, my friend paid more attention to me. I'm glad that I surrounded with a person that care for me.  I climbed the hill carefully.In the middle of hill, my friend help me carry out my backpack as I look tired. My friends gave me moral support in order to get at the end of the hill and we did it. The view from above of the hill was breathtaking. We took a lot of pictures together to make it a memory in the future.   </p>
